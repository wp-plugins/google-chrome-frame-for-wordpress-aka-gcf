---------------------- What is Google Chrome Frame ? ----------------------

Enable open web technologies in Internet Explorer
Google Chrome Frame is an open source plug-in that seamlessly brings Google Chrome's open web technologies and speedy JavaScript engine to Internet Explorer. With Google Chrome Frame, you can:

Start using open web technologies—such as the HTML5 canvas tag—right away, even technologies that aren't yet supported in Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Take advantage of JavaScript performance improvements to make your apps faster and more responsive.
Get started with Google Chrome Frame

Enabling Google Chrome Frame is simple. For most web pages, all you have to do is add a single tag to your pages and detect whether your users have installed Google Chrome Frame.

If Google Chrome Frame is not installed, you can direct your users to an installation page.
If Google Chrome Frame is installed, it detects the tag you added and works automatically. (More custom settings for addding the Chrome Frame meta tags will be updated in the near future)
